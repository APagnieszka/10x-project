# Foodzilla

A Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help households reduce food waste by enabling quick and easy addition of food products, tracking expiration dates, and receiving notifications about approaching expiration dates. Key MVP features include barcode scanning for automatic product data retrieval, OCR recognition of expiration dates from photos, and push/email notification systems. The app supports Polish and English languages with user-selectable preferences and is built using free technologies like QuaggaJS, Tesseract.js, and Supabase to minimize operational costs.

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.14.0 (as specified in `.nvmrc`)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Node.js Version Management

This project uses Node.js v22.14.0. Use nvm for version management:

```bash
# Install nvm if not already installed
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Reload terminal configuration
source ~/.zshrc

# Install and use the correct Node.js version
nvm install 22.14.0
nvm use 22.14.0

# Verify installation
node -v  # Should show v22.14.0
npm -v   # Should show 10.9.2
```

### Troubleshooting Version Issues

If your terminal shows an incorrect Node.js or npm version:

1. **Check if you're using the right version:**

   ```bash
   node -v  # Should be v22.14.0
   npm -v   # Should show 10.9.2
   ```

2. **If versions are incorrect, try these steps:**

   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the project directory
   cd /path/to/your/project

   # Use nvm to switch to the correct version
   nvm use

   # If that doesn't work, explicitly install and use
   nvm install 22.14.0
   nvm use 22.14.0
   ```

3. **Set as default (optional):**

   ```bash
   # Make this version your default for new terminal sessions
   nvm alias default 22.14.0
   ```

4. **Alternative: Use npx for specific npm version:**
   ```bash
   # Run npm commands with specific version without switching Node.js
   npx npm@10.9.2 install
   npx npm@10.9.2 run dev
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/APagnieszka/10x-project.git
   cd 10x-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser.

## Project Scope

Foodzilla implements the following core functionalities to help households manage food inventory and reduce waste:

- **User Authentication:** Single shared account for household using email and password with Supabase auth
- **Secure Data Access:** Household data (purchase history, product status) visible only to logged-in users on the same account
- **Product Addition:**
  - Barcode scanning (QuaggaJS) for automatic data retrieval from Open Food Facts
  - Manual product entry as alternative
  - Photo upload with OCR (Tesseract.js) for automatic expiration date recognition (â‰¥90% confidence auto-save, otherwise user confirmation)
  - Manual date entry with shortcuts (e.g., "+1 week")
- **Product Management:**
  - Marking products as "opened" with opening date tracking
  - Moving consumed products to shopping list
  - Interactive shopping list with draft mode for purchased items awaiting details
  - Easy removal of consumed products
  - Marking products as "spoiled" for waste tracking and weekly reports
- **Food Waste Reports:** Weekly summaries of spoiled products, historical access, and monthly/yearly reports on demand
- **Notifications:** Web-push notifications and daily email digest at 8:00 AM local time, with default reminders 3 days and 1 day before expiration, plus prompts for opened products over 3 days
- **Data Storage:** Permanent storage for product/barcode photos, automatic deletion of expiration date photos after 100 days
- **Privacy & Analytics:** Anonymous event tracking (opt-out available) for usage analysis
- **Multi-language Support:** Polish and English with user-selectable preference (Polish default)
- **Conflict Handling:** Last-write-wins strategy for concurrent edits
