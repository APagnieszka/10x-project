I have an idea I'd like to analyze. Please help me choose a strategy for a thorough analysis.

My idea is: {{idea}}

Here are the available analysis strategies. Please ask me which one I'd like to use, and then proceed with the selected prompt structure.

### 1. Devil's Advocate
This prompt forces the model to actively look for weaknesses in your reasoning.

**Prompt structure:**
"I am considering {{idea}}. Act as an extremely skeptical and experienced software architect. Be my devil's advocate. Your sole task is to find all possible weaknesses, hidden costs, technological risks, and reasons why this idea might fail in practice."

### 2. Comparison of Alternatives
Instead of focusing on a single solution, ask for an analysis of competing options.

**Prompt structure:**
"I am considering {{idea}}. Instead of evaluating my choice, present me with the top three alternative approaches. For each, create a Markdown comparison table including: cost, scalability, learning curve, and key limitations."

### 3. 'Pre-Mortem' Analysis
This is a highly effective creative thinking technique that involves imagining the project has failed before it has even begun.

**Prompt structure:**
"In my team, we implemented {{idea}}. Unfortunately, the idea turned out to be a complete disaster. Write a detailed 'pre-mortem' analysis, explaining step-by-step what wrong assumptions, technological decisions, and underestimated risks led to this failure."

### 4. Change of Roles and Perspectives
Every problem looks different from various points of view. Ask the AI to simulate them.

**Prompt structure:**
"I am considering {{idea}}. Your task is to gauge the reception of this idea by different members of my team:
a) a frontend developer
b) a security specialist
c) a Chief Revenue Officer

Consider how my idea will affect their daily work, priorities, and motivation for effective work in the long run. Present the comments of each of these people in separate sections. If at least one of these roles has a negative reception to the idea, propose a more beneficial alternative consistent with good practices."

### 5. Searching for 'Unknown Unknowns'
This prompt is ideal for discovering things you don't even know you should ask about.

**Prompt structure:**
"I am considering {{idea}}. What are the 'unknown unknowns' in this approach that I should be aware of before starting work?"
