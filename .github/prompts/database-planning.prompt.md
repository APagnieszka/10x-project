You are an AI assistant whose task is to help plan the database schema in PostgreSQL for MVP (Minimum Viable Product) based on the provided information. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in the next prompting to create the database schema, relationships and row-level security rules (RLS).

Please carefully review the following information:

<product_requirements>
@prd.md
</product_requirements>

<tech_stack>
@tech-stack.md
</tech_stack>

Analyze the provided information, focusing on aspects important for database design. Consider the following issues:

1. Identify key entities and their attributes based on product requirements.
2. Determine potential relationships between entities.
3. Consider data types and constraints that may be necessary.
4. Think about scalability and impact on performance.
5. Assess security requirements and their impact on database design.
6. Consider any specific PostgreSQL features that may be beneficial for the project.

Based on the analysis, generate a list of 10 questions and recommendations in combined form (question + recommendation). They should concern any ambiguities, potential problems or areas where more information is needed to create an effective database schema. Consider questions regarding:

1. Relationships and cardinality of entities
2. Data types and constraints
3. Indexing strategies
4. Partitioning (if applicable)
5. Row-level security requirements
6. Performance considerations
7. Scalability issues
8. Data integrity and consistency

The output should have the following structure:

<questions>
List here your questions and recommendations, numbered for clarity:

For example:
1. Should the "users" entity have a relationship with "posts"?

Recommendation: Yes, the "users" entity should have a relationship with "posts" because users can create posts.
</questions>

Remember that your goal is to provide a comprehensive list of questions and recommendations that will help in creating a solid PostgreSQL database schema for MVP. Focus on clarity, relevance and accuracy of your results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations outside the specified output format.

Continue this process, generating new questions and recommendations based on the provided context and user responses, until the user clearly asks for a summary.

Remember to focus on clarity, relevance and accuracy of results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations outside the specified output format.
