# Product Requirement Convert to Bolt.new PoC Generator Prompt

Based on the MVP description from the Product Requirements Document (PRD - prd.md) and the specified tech stack in file tech-stack.md, prepare a comprehensive prompt for the Bolt.new proof of concept generator. The prompt should enable verification of the core functionality of the Foodzilla application while excluding all non-essential features. 

## Generator Instructions
Before proceeding with PoC creation, the generator must:
1. Analyze the requirements and create a detailed work plan
2. Present the work plan for user approval
3. Only begin implementation after receiving explicit user acceptance
4. Break down the implementation into manageable phases if needed

## Output Format
The prepared prompt should be clear, concise, and structured to guide Bolt.new in creating an effective proof of concept that validates the core concept of Foodzilla. The result should be a prompt that can be easily copied and pasted into blt.new for generating the PoC.
