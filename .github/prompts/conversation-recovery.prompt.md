Let's pause for a moment and analyze the conversation so far. I feel that instead of getting closer to a solution, we're starting to go in circles and introduce more problems than we solve.

I need from you a detailed, objective summary of our work so far, which will help me start a new conversation with a clean context. Focus on specifics, not generalizations.

What works and should be preserved:
Describe all elements that have been correctly implemented and do not require changes. For each element, explain why it works well and what specific requirement it fulfills.

Where our approach failed:
Identify moments in this conversation where we started to go astray. What implementation decisions turned out to be wrong? Which repair attempts worsened the situation instead of improving it? Be detailed - instead of 'the code doesn't work', describe precisely what behavior we observe, what we expect, and what specific errors occur.

What we learned:
What new information did we discover during the experiments? Which of the original assumptions turned out to be incomplete or imprecise? Did additional requirements or constraints appear that we didn't consider at the beginning?

Updated problem context:
Based on all the above conclusions, formulate a complete description of the problem that I should convey in a new conversation. This description should be detailed enough that an independent programmer could understand exactly what we are trying to achieve, without access to this conversation.

Save the summary in conversation-summary-{timestamp}.md
